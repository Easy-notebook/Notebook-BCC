# Stage 7: Stability Assessment

## Stage Goal
Assess model stability and robustness under reasonable perturbations through systematic analysis.

## Core Activities
- Test data perturbations (sample, feature, distribution)
- Analyze model parameter sensitivity
- Execute multi-variation evaluation
- Calculate stability metrics
- Provide improvement recommendations

## PCS Framework Integration (Core Focus: Stability)
- Comprehensively assess stability from multiple dimensions
- Establish quantitative stability evaluation
- Build long-term stability monitoring

## Quality Checklist
- [ ] Perturbation testing covers key dimensions
- [ ] Sensitivity analysis sufficient
- [ ] Stability metrics correct
- [ ] Monitoring mechanism comprehensive
