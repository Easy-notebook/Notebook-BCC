# Stage 5: Model Implementation Execution

## Stage Goal
Execute modeling strategy through systematic feature engineering, model training, and optimization to build high-quality predictive models.

## Core Activities
- Execute feature processing and engineering
- Implement multiple modeling methods
- Perform hyperparameter optimization
- Monitor and diagnose training process
- Generate trained model collection

## PCS Framework Integration
- Predictability: Prevent data leakage, validate on hold-out set
- Computability: Set random seeds, ensure reproducibility
- Stability: Test on perturbed data, validate consistency

## Quality Checklist
- [ ] Feature engineering correctly implemented
- [ ] Multiple methods successfully trained
- [ ] No data leakage in training
- [ ] Results completely reproducible
