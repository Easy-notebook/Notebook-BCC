## Stage Goal
Establish the foundation of data existence through systematic data discovery, structure analysis, and relevance assessment to ensure data can support project objectives.

## Core Activities

### Data Collection and Inventory
- Execute data collection strategy based on Chapter 0 planning
- Verify reliability of data acquisition channels
- Establish data version control and traceability mechanisms
- Complete initial data inventory (rows, columns, file size)
- Verify data completeness and accessibility
- Establish data catalog and metadata records

### Data Structure Discovery
- Analyze data hierarchy and organizational structure
- Identify primary keys, foreign keys, and index fields
- Discover relationships between data tables
- Determine data types (numeric, categorical, text, temporal)
- Identify mixed data types and anomalous formats
- Explore data distribution characteristics (mean, std, quantiles)

### Variable Semantic Analysis
- Map variable n to business concepts
- Identify measurement units and scales
- Understand business context and usage scenarios
- Assess variable value reasonableness and validity
- Verify variable interpretation accuracy with domain experts
- Obtain expert opinions on variable importance

### Observation Unit Identification
- Identify basic observation units (individuals, events, time points)
- Determine unique identifiers for observation units
- Analyze observation unit representativeness and completeness
- Identify temporal span and sampling frequency
- Analyze time series continuity and consistency
- Identify geographic or spatial distribution

### Variable Relevance Assessment
- Analyze correlation between variables and target variable
- Identify potential predictive variables
- Assess multicollinearity among variables
- Establish variable priority ranking
- Verify statistical relevance aligns with business logic

### PCS Hypothesis Generation
- Generate testable hypotheses based on PCS framework
- Design experimental schemes for hypothesis validation
- Identify factors affecting predictability and stability

## PCS Framework Integration

### Predictability
