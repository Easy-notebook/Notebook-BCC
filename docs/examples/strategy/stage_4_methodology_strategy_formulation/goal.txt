# Stage 4: Methodology Strategy Formulation

## Stage Goal
Formulate comprehensive modeling strategy including feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation framework based on data understanding.

## Core Activities
- Design feature engineering strategy
- Establish model method candidate set
- Plan cross-validation and evaluation approach
- Design hyperparameter optimization strategy
- Develop implementation plan with risk mitigation

## PCS Framework Integration
- Predictability: Prioritize methods with good generalization
- Computability: Ensure methods are implementable and efficient
- Stability: Select robust methods and test sensitivity

## Quality Checklist
- [ ] Feature engineering strategy matches data
- [ ] Model selection considers constraints
- [ ] Evaluation strategy comprehensive
- [ ] Implementation plan realistic
