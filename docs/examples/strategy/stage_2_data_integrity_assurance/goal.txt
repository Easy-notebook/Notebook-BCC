# Stage 2: Data Integrity Assurance

## Stage Goal
Ensure data completeness, accuracy, and consistency through systematic cleaning and validation processes to establish analysis-ready high-quality dataset.

## Core Activities

### Dimensional Integrity Validation
- Verify data dimensions (rows, columns) match expectations
- Validate primary key and foreign key integrity
- Check time series data continuity and completeness
- Identify orphaned records and reference integrity issues

### Value Validity Assurance
- Validate data type correctness for all fields
- Verify value ranges are reasonable and within constraints
- Apply business rules for data validation
- Standardize data formats and encodings across dataset

### Completeness Integrity Restoration
- Analyze missing value patterns (MCAR, MAR, MNAR)
- Execute appropriate missing value treatment strategies
- Detect and treat outliers using statistical methods
- Identify and handle duplicate records appropriately

### Comprehensive Integrity Verification
- Assess effectiveness of data cleaning operations
- Verify internal data consistency post-processing
- Calculate comprehensive data quality metrics
- Validate PCS framework alignment throughout cleaning

## PCS Framework Integration

### Predictability
- Preserve predictive relationships during cleaning
- Ensure validation data quality and representativeness
- Avoid over-cleaning that damages generalization capability

### Computability
- Establish reproducible data cleaning workflows
- Develop automated data quality checking tools
- Optimize cleaning process computational efficiency

### Stability
- Test sensitivity of different cleaning parameters
- Verify cleaning method robustness to data variations
- Ensure cleaning consistency across different data batches
