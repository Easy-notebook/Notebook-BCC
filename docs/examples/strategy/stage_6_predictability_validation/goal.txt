# Stage 6: Predictability Validation

## Stage Goal
Ensure model reliable generalization and predictive performance on new data through systematic validation.

## Core Activities
- Execute rigorous cross-validation
- Evaluate on independent test set
- Validate temporal performance
- Test domain generalization
- Assess business impact

## PCS Framework Integration (Core Focus: Predictability)
- Implement multi-level prediction capability validation
- Ensure reliable prediction on new data
- Establish continuous performance monitoring

## Quality Checklist
- [ ] Cross-validation correctly executed
- [ ] Test set completely independent
- [ ] Temporal validation considers business
- [ ] Validation supports decision-making
