      The stage began with confirming data existence through successful loading of the housing dataset. This provided a verified baseline for all subsequent analyses. Key decisions involved verifying both the file path and data integrity before proceeding. This approach minimized risk of structural or semantic inconsistencies in later steps. The team confirmed the dataset’s adequacy for modeling and hypothesis development, setting a stable foundation for structure exploration.
