    <whathappened>
      <overview>
        Verified dataset accessibility, recorded metadata, confirmed schema readability, and compiled data_existence_report successfully.
      </overview>
      <key_findings>
        The dataset is well-structured and ready for schema exploration; no missing or corrupted files detected.
      </key_findings>
    </whathappened>
    <recommendations_for_next>
      <if_continuing_behavior>
        None required — current verification step is complete.
      </if_continuing_behavior>
      <if_moving_forward>
        Proceed to data_structure_discovery using df_raw. Focus on documenting column names, data types, and nullability to produce the data_structure_document.
